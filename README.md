This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies
```bash
npm i
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Integrate with backend

You will find that endpoint for backend in utils/constants.js. Currently it is set to **http://localhost:3001/functionup** . 
This means that to integrate your backend solution with this frontend application, you must run the backend code at 3001 port (modify the index.js file there to change the port to 3001)
